# Leaderboard And Titles

**Leaderboards**

- There is now a Leaderboards action on your body and hand.
Selecting this will open up a new window in which you can select a leaderboard to view, or opt in/out of the system.
Players will be opted out by default. Opting out means that your skill entry will still display on the leaderboard, but your name will show as "Unknown"
Opting into the system will allow any player looking at any leaderboard to see your name if you're in the results.
Leaderboards will display only the top 20 highest skilled players in each skill. This count includes anyone opted out of the Leaderboard system.
If you are one of the top 20 in a leaderboard, your entry will be bold. It will also display your name even if you're opted out, but only for you.
All GM characters are exempt from leaderboard entries. If someone has 99 in a skill and shows as Unknown, it's a player who obtained it legitimately and is opted out, not a GM.

- There are 134 achievements to choose from with a variety of conditions. These achievements have been hand selected out of the nearly 500 in Wurm because they have a counter attached (more than a yes/no).Many achievements have been edited with new names, descriptions, and requirements to make them more functional than their vanilla iteration. Some of these achievements are essentially duplicates, with conditions such as "Kill a Spider" and "Kill 50 Spiders" being some examples.

- Most Unique Achievements - Leaderboard displaying which players have the most unique achievements. This is not the sum of all achievements, but rather a counter for how many they have at least one count in.

- Most Affinities - Leaderboard displaying which players have the most total affinities across all their skills.

- Largest Structures - Leaderboard displaying the largest and most complex structures on the map.
