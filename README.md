# Leaderboard And Titles

There are 134 achievements to choose from with a variety of conditions. These achievements have been hand selected out of the nearly 500 in Wurm because they have a counter attached (more than a yes/no).Many achievements have been edited with new names, descriptions, and requirements to make them more functional than their vanilla iteration. Some of these achievements are essentially duplicates, with conditions such as "Kill a Spider" and "Kill 50 Spiders" being some examples.
