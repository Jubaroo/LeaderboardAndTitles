# Leaderboard And Titles

# **Leaderboard**

- There is now a Leaderboards action on your body and hand, as well as on any skill.
Selecting this will open up a new window in which you can select a leaderboard to view, or opt in/out of the system.
Players will be **opted out by default**. Opting out means that your skill entry will still display on the leaderboard, but your name will show as "Unknown"
Opting into the system will allow any player looking at any leaderboard to see your name if you're in the results.
Leaderboards will display only the top 20 highest skilled players in each skill. This count includes anyone opted out of the Leaderboard system.
If you are one of the top 20 in a leaderboard, your entry will be bold. It will also display your name even if you're opted out, but only for you.
All GM characters are exempt from leaderboard entries. If someone has 99 in a skill and shows as Unknown, it's a player who obtained it **legitimately** and is opted out, not a GM.

- **Total Skill** - tallies the total combined skill level of each player, then forms a leaderboard of the top 50 most overall skilled players to display. 

- **High Skills** - displays the highest skill values on the server, along with the player who has it and the skill it is. This is currently the only leaderboard where a single player can have multiple entries.

*There are 134 achievements to choose from with a variety of conditions. These achievements have been hand selected out of the nearly 500 in Wurm because they have a counter attached (more than a yes/no).Many achievements have been edited with new names, descriptions, and requirements to make them more functional than their vanilla iteration. Some of these achievements are essentially duplicates, with conditions such as "Kill a Spider" and "Kill 50 Spiders" being some examples.*

- **Most Unique Achievements** - Leaderboard displaying which players have the most unique achievements. This is not the sum of all achievements, but rather a counter for how many they have at least one count in.

- **Most Affinities** - Leaderboard displaying which players have the most total affinities across all their skills.

- **Largest Structures** - Leaderboard displaying the largest and most complex structures on the map.

- **Kills** - displays the total kills in PvP a player has obtained. This counts any contribution on the right side of a death tab. (Unused)

- **Deaths** - displays the total amount of times a player has died in PvP combat. This counts any death that occurs in a death tab. (Unused) 

- **Depots Captured** - displays the amount of depots a player has captured. This only counts for the player who actually performs and finishes the capture action. Nearby players do not get a credit. (Used by a different mod)

- **Uniques Slain** - Displays how many uniques each player has slain. Unfortunately, this will not apply to retroactive kills before this update was applied. Limited to top 20 entries. 

- **Titans Slain** - Displays how many titans each player has slain. Like the uniques leaderboard, this will also not apply retroactive kills from before this update. Limited to top 20 entries. (Unused)
